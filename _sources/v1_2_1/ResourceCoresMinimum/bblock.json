  "abstract": "Minimum reserved number of CPU cores.\n\nMay be a fractional value to indicate to a scheduling algorithm that one core can be allocated to\nmultiple jobs. For example, a value of 0.25 indicates that up to 4 jobs\nmay run in parallel on 1 core. A value of 1.25 means that up to 3 jobs\ncan run on a 4 core system (4/1.25 ~ 3).\n\nProcesses can only share a core allocation if the sum of each of their 'ramMax', 'tmpdirMax', and\n'outdirMax' requests also do not exceed the capacity of the node.\n\nProcesses sharing a core must have the same level of isolation (typically a container\nor VM) that they would normally have.\n\nThe reported number of CPU cores reserved for the process, which is available to expressions \non the 'CommandLineTool' as 'runtime.cores', must be a non-zero integer, and may be calculated by\nrounding up the cores request to the next whole number.\n\nScheduling systems may allocate fractional CPU resources by setting quotas or scheduling weights.\nScheduling systems that do not support fractional CPUs may round up the request to the next whole number.\n",
