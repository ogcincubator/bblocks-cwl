# CWLTextPatternID (Schema)

`ogc.cwl.v1_2_1.CWLTextPatternID` *v1.2.1*

Generic identifier name pattern.

[*Status*](http://www.opengis.net/def/status): Under development

## Description

Identifier with text pattern that can allow additional non-ASCII characters depending on regex implementation.
The identifier allows a '#' or a relative 'sub/part#ref' prefix, to support references to other definitions
in the CWL document, such as when using 'SchemaDefRequirement'.

JSON spec regex does not include '\w' in its default subset to allow all word-like unicode characters
(see reference: https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/regular_expressions.html).

Since support is implementation specific, add both the ASCII-only and '\w' representation simultaneously
and let the parser reading this document apply whichever is more relevant or supported
(see discussion: https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwl-v1.2/pull/256#discussion_r1234037814).
