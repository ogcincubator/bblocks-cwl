# CWLScatterMethod (Schema)

`ogc.cwl.v1_2_1.CWLScatterMethod` *v1.2.1*

Describes how to decompose the scattered input into a discrete
set of jobs. When 'dotproduct', specifies that each of the input arrays
are aligned and one element taken from each array to construct each job.
It is an error if all input arrays are of different length. When 'nested_crossproduct',
specifies the Cartesian product of the inputs, producing a job for every
combination of the scattered inputs. The output must be nested arrays
for each level of scattering, in the order that the input arrays are listed
in the scatter field. When 'flat_crossproduct', specifies the Cartesian
product of the inputs, producing a job for every combination of the scattered
inputs. The output arrays must be flattened to a single level, but otherwise
listed in the order that the input arrays are listed in the scatter field.
