  scatter:
    description: 'The scatter field specifies one or more input parameters which will
      be scattered.


      An input parameter may be listed more than once. The declared type of each

      input parameter implicitly becomes an array of items of the input parameter
      type.

      If a parameter is listed more than once, it becomes a nested array. As a result,

      upstream parameters which are connected to scattered parameters must be arrays.


      All output parameter types are also implicitly wrapped in arrays. Each job

      in the scatter results in an entry in the output array.


      If any scattered parameter runtime value is an empty array, all outputs are

      set to empty arrays and no work is done for the step, according to applicable
      scattering rules.
